  Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows developers to create native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a single codebase. 
  Electron is widely used in popular applications such as Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Discord.
  It provides a rich set of APIs for accessing native system features and integrates well with Node.js.
